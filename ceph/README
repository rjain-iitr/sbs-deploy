Scripts for ceph-deploy automations are described below, please modify "./inventory" file to specify the admin,monitor,osds as per your requirements. For example, I have added admin host with its private key.

We can set export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=false where we will run ansible so that it will be able to do SSH without any prompt.

To deploy ceph:
ansible-playbook -v run_me.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu

Atomic playbooks:

1. add_ceph_admin.yaml
   - It will add the Admin node of ceph.
   - it uses vars/ceph_info.yml to get admin.(ip/host), IdentityFile and ceph_deb_version.

	ansible-playbook -v add_ceph_admin.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu

2. configure_ceph_nodes.yaml
   - it will be used to add other ceph nodes like monitors or osd nodes.
   - it uses vars/ceph_info.yml to get mons/osds ip,hostname and ceph_user,IdentityFile and for all these nodes, we need to define a nodes variable in inventory file to have all these nodes IP.

	ansible-playbook -v configure_ceph_nodes.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu

   We may also need to do proxy or ntp settings on these nodes using add_proxy_settings.yaml and add_ntp_settings.yaml playbooks.

3. install_ceph.yaml
   - it installs ceph on the hosts(mons and osds nodes) specified in vars/ceph_info.yml file.

	ansible-playbook -v install_ceph.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu 

4. ceph_create_initial.yaml
   - It does the monitor initial steps
	ansible-playbook -v ceph_create_initial.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu 

5. ceph_add_osds.yaml

   Before running this playbook, we should check the disk in osd nodes which we can use for osd prepare/activate. We can check this manually and add the required devices in vars/osd_info.yml.
       - ceph-deploy disk list <hostname> //do this on admin node e.g. ceph-deploy disk list <monitor_host_name>

   After populating osd_info.yml, we can run ceph_add_osds.yaml to prepare and activate the required osds.
        ansible-playbook -v ceph_add_osds.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu

Supporting playbooks:
1. purge_cluster.yaml:
   -- If at any point, you run into trouble and you want to start over, execute the following to purge the configuration:
      ceph-deploy purgedata {ceph-node} [{ceph-node}]
      ceph-deploy forgetkeys
      ceph-deploy purge {ceph-node} [{ceph-node}]

2. add_proxy_settings.yaml
   -- To add proxy settings in nodes(mons/osds), we can do it separately on each node or all nodes by specifying hostname( and the required nodes in inventory file for hostname)
   -- It uses the proxy_ip and proxy port as specified in vars/proxy_info.yml 
   	ansible-playbook -v create_initial.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu -e hostname=nodes
       	ansible-playbook -v create_initial.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu -e hostname=mon
