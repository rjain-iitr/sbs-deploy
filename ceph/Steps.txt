1. Specify the required variables in ceph_info.yml, ntp_info.yml, osd_info.yml, proxy_info.yml (self-explanatory) and add public IPs in [admin] and [nodes] in inventory_ceph file.
2. ansible-playbook -v deploy_ceph.yaml -i vars/inventory_ceph -u block_team
3. Check the disks available manually on osd nodes by running the following command on admin node:
ceph-deploy disk list <osd node>
See the free disks and add in vars/osd_info.yml
4. ansible-playbook -v ceph_add_osds.yaml -i vars/inventory_ceph -u block_team
