1. Specify the required variables in vars/ceph_info.yml, vars/ntp_info.yml, vars/osd_info.yml, vars/proxy_info.yml (self-explanatory) and run the following:
   
	 ansible-playbook -v deploy_ceph.yaml -i vars/inventory_ceph -u block_team

2. Sometimes we may need to check the disks available manually on osd nodes by running the following command on admin node:
ceph-deploy disk list <osd node>
See the free disks and add in vars/osd_info.yml

After adding osds, run the following:

	 ansible-playbook -v ceph_add_osds.yaml -i vars/inventory_ceph -u block_team
